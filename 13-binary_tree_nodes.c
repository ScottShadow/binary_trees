/**
 * binary_tree_nodes - Counts the number of nodes with at least 1 child

 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the binary tree.
 *
 * Description: This function counts the number of nodes in a binary tree
 * that have at least one child, excluding leaf nodes. If the tree is NULL,
 * the function returns 0, and a NULL pointer is not considered a node.
 *
 * Return: The number of nodes with at least one child in the binary tree,
 *         or 0 if the tree is NULL.
