/**
 * binary_tree_size - Measures the size of a binary tree.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the binary tree.
 *
 * Description: This function calculates the size of a binary tree,
 * which is the total number of nodes in the tree, including both
 * internal (non-leaf) nodes and leaf nodes. If the tree is NULL,
 * the function returns 0, indicating an empty tree.
 *
 * Return: The size of the binary tree, or 0 if the tree is NULL.
