 * binary_tree_height - Measures the height of a binary tree.

 * Description: This function calculates the height of a binary tree,
 * which is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf.
 * If the tree is NULL, the function returns 0.
 *
 * Return: The height of the binary tree, or 0 if the tree is NULL.
