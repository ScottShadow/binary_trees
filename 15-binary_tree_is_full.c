/**
 * binary_tree_is_full - Checks if a binary tree is full.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the binary tree.
 *
 * Description: This function checks whether a binary tree is full, meaning
 * every node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children, and all leaf nodes are
 * at the same level. If the tree is NULL, the function returns 0.
 *
 * Return: 1 if the binary tree is full, 0 otherwise or if the tree is NULL.
